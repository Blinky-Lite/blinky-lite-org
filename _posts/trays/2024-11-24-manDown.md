<p style="color:#fdc100;font-weight:900;;font-size:200%;">A complete system fully integrated with Blinky-Lite</p>
From ringing church bells, to the modern world of mobile phones, man-down systems have been around since the dawn of time. So why would we need yet another one? It is because most man-down systems are focused on the endpoint device instead of the entire system. The resulting implementation is often a hodge-podge collection of software that is poorly integrated and difficult to operate and maintain.

    <div class="medium-8 columns">
        <p style="color:#fdc100;font-weight:900;;font-size:200%;">Easy to use and multi-functional</p>
        <span> As an alternative, Blinky-Lite now offers a man-down system that is seamlessly integrated with Blinky-Lite. The Blinky-Lite man-down system is simple to use. In an emergency situation, one does not have time to fumble around with a mobile phone, entering a password, then opening an app and hoping there is a GSM or wifi connection available. The Blinky-Lite man-down call device contains a simple red button that the user presses to call for help. In addition, the call device has an accelerometer to detect lack of motion or a fall and independently call for help if the user is incapacitated.

   <div class="medium-8 columns">
        <p style="color:#fdc100;font-weight:900;;font-size:200%;">LoRa Technology</p>
        <span>The call device uses a long range radio transmission, LoRa for short,  to signal for help. The call signal is detected by one or more of several LoRa receivers positioned around the facility offering redundancy, positioning, and complete coverage of hard to reach locations. The LoRa communication is completely independent and can be implemented in extremely remote locations such as at sea.

        <p style="color:#fdc100;font-weight:900;;font-size:200%;">Role Based Authentication</p>
        <span>The Blinky-Lite man-down system uses Blinky-lite role-based -access for authentication before a user can remove a call device from its cradle. Authentication allows tracking of individual users throughout the facility giving first responders a clear picture of where personnel are located.</span>

        <p style="color:#fdc100;font-weight:900;;font-size:200%;">Publish-Subscribe Notificiations</p>
        <span>The Blinky-Lite man-down system also takes advantage of the Blinky-lite publish-subscribe notification system so that multiple teams can respond to an emergency providing an extra layer of redundancy. As with all Blinky-Lite applications, the authentication, tracking, and configuration applications are web apps providing easy to use secure remote access anywhere.
