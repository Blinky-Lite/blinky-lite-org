Out of the box, Blinky-Lite provides a comprehensive suite of applications. Since there is no need to add 3rd party solutions or external custom scripts (such as the ubiquitous python scripts infesting many other control systems), the Blinky-Lite architecture is self-contained, hence more reliable and secure.
